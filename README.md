# TS-Platformer

This is an example game built using TypeScript. It uses such features as a resolution-independent camera with aspect-ratio dependent letterboxing, sprite sheets, a class to handle common text rendering functionality, and more.

## Running the Game

This uses [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) - to run, simply run `yarn start` and point your browser to http://localhost:1234. Parcel automatically hosts a server with hot-reloading.

## Building the Game

To build, run `yarn build`. This will output production-ready files to the `dist` folder.
